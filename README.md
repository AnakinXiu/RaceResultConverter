# Introduction 
This is a small tool to convert racing results between different RC timing systems.

The purpose that I create this tool originally is to use the race result board video generate tool `TimeLap` which Mr. Zon created.

The `TimeLap` only support the data from `ICTagLapCounter` which also created by Mr. Zon, but normally I use ZRound as the race timing system. 

To have my racing data export as video, I create this to to convert ZRound racing data to Mr. Zon's format.

Maybe in the future I'll create my own version to generate video directly from `ZRound` and `TrackGenius`.
